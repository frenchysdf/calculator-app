# Apple Calculator Simulator

I am building this little calculator to practice on my CSS and JavaScript skills. There will be bugs as in every software. This is a learning experience

Disclaimer: This app is neither endorsed by Apple nor do I claim it to be, I built this for my own fun.

TODO!
Write the JavaScript code to make it work, HTML and CSS are complete; get to work!
